# node101

Very basic `node.js` script with some core modules.  

Desc:  
`app.js` is the main driver code  
`routes.js` is the code contains all routing logic (only 2 at this moment)  

To run:  
`node app.js`  
or  
install `npm` with `npm init`  
`npm start` otherwise `npm run {customName}` (edit `package.json`)
